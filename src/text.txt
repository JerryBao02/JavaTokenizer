🌌 Whispers of the Digital Wind 🌌

In the land of bytes and bits,
Where 0 & 1 perform their wits,
The @ sun rises over localhost,
And #dreams of code are never lost.

Through ~/home the breezes hum,
Soft & gentle, they slowly drum.
A #hashtag floats on fleeting air,
While ! exclaims without a care.

The syntax moon with (),
Casts == shadows upon the dunes.
While + and - play hide and seek,
And ~ the stars begin to speak.

A whirlwind of {} and [],
Dances wild with <> unseen.
The & clings tightly to the |,
While ^ and % flicker nearby.

In this realm, we laugh and cry,
With try {} blocks we softly sigh.
Yet still we return and carry on,
While catch(e) mends what went wrong.

In the depths of digital sea,
Where forgotten loops drift endlessly,
The ; waits in silent grace,
While //comments vanish without a trace.

And so, dear printf(), let us sing,
Of console.log() and what it brings.
For though we code through night and day,
The #debug winds still drift away. 🌬️✨
